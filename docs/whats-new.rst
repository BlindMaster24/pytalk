:version:`1.6.1` - 2025-10-12
---------------------------------

Added
~~~~~
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff for initial connection failures (`CLIENTEVENT_CON_FAILED`) in `TeamTalkBot.add_server()`.
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff on kick (`CLIENTEVENT_CMD_MYSELF_KICKED`), controlled by `reconnect` flag in `TeamTalkBot.add_server()`.
- `backoff_config` parameter (dict) in `TeamTalkBot.add_server()` for per-server customization of backoff behavior (`base`, `exponent`, `max_value`, `max_tries`).
- `pytalk.backoff.Backoff` class for managing exponential backoff logic with jitter.
- `TeamTalkInstance.initial_connect_loop()` method for initial connect & login sequence with retries.
- `TeamTalkInstance.force_reconnect()` method for manual triggering of a full reconnection sequence.

Improved
~~~~~~~~
- Reconnection and retry logic now uses exponential backoff with jitter by default to enhance server stability by desynchronizing mass client reconnections.
- Synchronous SDK calls (`TeamTalkInstance.connect()`, `TeamTalkInstance.login()`) now run in a thread pool executor during connection loops to prevent blocking asyncio event loop.

Fixed
~~~~~
- Corrected permission logic in `kick_user` to allow action if user has global kick rights OR is a channel operator.
- Fixed unreachable code and improved error handling in `kick_user` and `ban_user` methods to provide more specific exceptions.
- Removed incorrect permission check from the internal `_do_cmd` method, ensuring checks are handled by the specific calling methods.
- Added missing `TeamTalkException` import in `pytalk/instance.py`.
- `TeamTalkInstance.connected` and `TeamTalkInstance.logged_in` flags are correctly updated to `False` on `CLIENTEVENT_CMD_MYSELF_KICKED` before reconnection attempts.
- `Backoff` state is reset only after a complete and successful connection and login sequence in `TeamTalkInstance`.

:version:`1.6.0` - 2025-06-05
---------------------------------

Added
~~~~~
- Added media file streaming capabilities:
    - Introduced `pytalk.TeamTalkInstance.start_streaming_media_file_to_channel` for streaming local media files to a channel.
    - Introduced `pytalk.TeamTalkInstance.stop_streaming_media_file_to_channel` to stop active media file streaming.
- Introduced a new `pytalk.enums.Status` helper class for `pytalk.TeamTalkInstance.change_status`:
    - Allows combining user status modes (e.g., `online`, `away`) with gender properties (`.male`, `.female`, `.neutral`) in a more Pythonic and intuitive manner (e.g., `Status.online.female`).

Improved
~~~~~~~~
- The `pytalk.TeamTalkInstance.change_status` method now accepts a combined status integer, intelligently preserving other non-mode/gender related status flags (like video or desktop sharing) when updating.

Changed
~~~~~~~
- In `TeamTalkInstance.login()`, the automatic channel join based on `server_info.join_channel_id`
  will now only attempt to join a channel if `join_channel_id` is strictly positive (>0).
  Previously, a value of 0 or negative would result in joining the root channel. Now, such
  values will result in no channel being joined automatically.

Fixed
~~~~~
- In `Server.join_channel()`, attempting to join a channel by path with an empty or
  whitespace-only string now correctly results in no action (and returns `False`).
  Previously, this would lead to an attempt to join the root channel.
- Fixed several linter issues.

:version:`1.5.1` - 2025-05-16
---------------------------------

Fixed
~~~~~
- Improved stability of audio event processing in ``pytalk.TeamTalkInstance`` by implementing an SDK lock (`_audio_sdk_lock`) to serialize access to critical TeamTalk SDK audio functions. This addresses potential segmentation faults and race conditions during high-frequency audio events.
- Enhanced resource management for audio blocks by ensuring SDK pointers are correctly acquired, data is copied, and pointers are released reliably, even in error scenarios within the event processing loop.
- Refined the internal logic for handling ``CLIENTEVENT_USER_STATECHANGE`` to correctly enable/disable audio block events based on user voice transmission status.

Improved
~~~~~~~~
- Restructured parts of the internal ``_process_events`` method in ``pytalk.TeamTalkInstance`` for better clarity and logical flow of event handling.

:version:`1.5.0` - 2025-05-15
---------------------------------

Added
~~~~~
- Reinstated audio receiving events: `on_user_audio` and `on_muxed_audio` are now available again. (Originally planned for 1.4.5)
- Added new events: `on_user_account_new` (called when a new user account is created on the server) and `on_user_account_remove` (called when a user account is deleted from the server).
- Enhanced `pytalk.TeamTalkInstance.create_user_account` method:
    - Added `user_rights` parameter to allow specifying user permissions (using `pytalk.Permission` values) upon user account creation.
    - Added `note` parameter to allow setting a note upon user account creation.

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Corrected the return type annotation for `pytalk.TeamTalkInstance.create_user_account` from `TeamTalkUserAccount` to `bool` to accurately reflect its actual return value.

Fixed
~~~~~
- Resolved an issue where documentation was not being generated correctly for some elements.
- Fixed Flake8 `DAR203` error related to return type mismatch in `pytalk.TeamTalkInstance.create_user_account` docstring.

Improved
~~~~~~~~
- Updated and significantly clarified docstrings for `pytalk.TeamTalkInstance.create_user_account`, including detailed explanations of new parameters and default behaviors.

Notes
~~~~~
- The core logic for `on_user_audio` and `on_muxed_audio` has not been altered in this version. If your bot encounters issues or crashes when using these re-enabled audio events, please report them via a GitHub issue. While they may function correctly, thorough testing in your environment is recommended. (Note originally from 1.4.5)

:version:`1.4.1` - 2025-05-01
---------------------------------

This release marks a significant transition! The library is now **Pytalk**, residing in its own dedicated repository. This separation stems from the current maintainer's decision to pursue a distinct development path, introducing changes that may differ from the original vision for teamtalk.py held by its previous owner. Driven by differing opinions on future development, a desire for more rapid updates, and the goal of making specific improvements, Pytalk now operates independently as a separate library. As part of this new direction, the restructuring also aims to align Pytalk more closely with the user-friendly patterns found in libraries like discord.py/py-cord, enhancing the developer experience.

Breaking Changes & Important Notices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- **Project Renamed:** The library is now officially ``pytalk``. This project is independent and not related to ``teamtalk.py``.
  **Action Required:** You **must** update your import statements (e.g., change ``import teamtalk`` to ``import pytalk``) and any other code references. Please review the updated documentation for new conventions.
- **Separate Repository:** Pytalk has been moved to its own repository.
- **PyPI Availability:** Versions prior to 1.4.4 under the old name will **no longer be available** for installation from PyPI. You must use version 1.4.4 or newer of ``pytalk``.
- **Changelog History:** While older versions are unavailable on PyPI, previous changelog entries will be maintained within the new repository for historical reference.

Fixes / Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- **Complete Audio Function Overhaul:** All audio-related functions have been thoroughly reviewed, fixed, and rewritten for improved stability and correctness.
- **Accurate Audio Calculations:** Audio calculation formulas were taken directly from the official TeamTalk Qt client and now work perfectly.

Notes
~~~~~
- Please update your dependencies to use the new ``pytalk`` package name and version 1.4.1 or later.
- Review your existing code for any instances of the old library name and update them to ``pytalk``.

:version:`1.4.0` - 2025-04-28

In addition, we now do not ignore the first 1 second of events, and we have fixed various recursion errors when trying to get underlying SDK properties from a teamtalk.Channel. We have also fixed a PermissionError when trying to kick a user from a channel, and errors on linux with certain functions due to improper use of sdk.ttstr.

Added
~~~~~
